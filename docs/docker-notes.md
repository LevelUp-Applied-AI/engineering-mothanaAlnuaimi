## Hello World Test

Output of `docker run hello-world`:

```bash
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

Digest: sha256:85404b3c53951c3ff5d40de0972b1bb21fafa2e8daa235355baf44f33db9dbdd
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

## Postgres Container

Command used:

```bash
docker run -d --name pg-prework -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=prework -p 5432:5432 postgres:15-alpine
```

### Startup Logs

Output of `docker logs pg-prework`:

```bash
pg-prework
```

Startup confirmation line found:

`LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections`

## Stop and Restart

Output of `docker stop pg-prework`:

```bash
pg-prework

Output of `docker restart pg-prework`:

```bash
pg-prework
```

Output of `docker logs pg-prework` after restart:

```bash
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".
This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.utf8".
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".

Data page checksums are disabled.

Success. You can now start the database server using:

    pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -l logfile start

initdb: hint: You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or --auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.

## Issues Encountered

Docker Desktop was not running at first, so `docker run hello-world` failed to connect to the Docker API. I opened Docker Desktop, waited for the engine to start, and then reran the commands successfully.
